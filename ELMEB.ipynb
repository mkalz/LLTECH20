    "College examn scores are the basis for access to higher education. An important question is what influences these examn score and how we can build policies in education that will make sure that we have equality and fair chances for everybody to get access to higher education. In the dataset by Kimmons (2012) you can explore the associations between 8 variables: 1.) gender,\t2.) race/ethnicity, 3.) parental level of education,\t4.) lunch provision, 5.) attendance of a test preparation course, 6.) math score,\t7.) reading score and 8.) writing score."
